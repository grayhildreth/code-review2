# _Vacation Suggester_

#### By _**Gray Hildreth**_

## Description

_This program is designed to suggest a vacation destination based off of user input through a survey-style interface.  It uses HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Jquery, and Bootstrap._

[Check out the program on gh-pages!](http://grayhildreth.github.io/code-review2)

## Known Bugs

_The survey is not outputting a vacation destination, it is likely that there are issues with the JavaScript.  However, the survey does function properly when tested in JSFiddle._
